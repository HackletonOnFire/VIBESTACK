### **2025-07-31**

**14:00 - 15:00 UTC | Project Initialization & Verification (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)**

*   **Summary:** Set up the initial project structure for all three services: frontend, backend, and ML.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Initialized a Next.js 14+ frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
    *   Set up a Node.js backend using the Express framework and TypeScript.
    *   Initialized a Python ML service using FastAPI with a dedicated virtual environment.
    *   Verified that all three services install dependencies and start correctly using `npm run dev` and `python main.py`.
    *   **Outcome:** All services confirmed running on their respective ports (3000, 5000, 8000) with basic health checks passing.

**15:00 - 16:00 UTC | Environment & Supabase Config (Task 1.4 & Verification)**

*   **Summary:** Configured environment variables across all services and successfully verified the connection to the user's Supabase project.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Updated `next.config.js`, `backend/src/server.ts`, and `ml-service/main.py` to securely load and validate environment variables.
    *   Enhanced service health checks to report the status of their environment configuration.
    *   Created `docs/environment-setup.md` with detailed instructions for other developers.
*   **Supabase Connection Verification:**
    *   Created a test script (`scripts/test-supabase.js`) to provide a definitive connection test.
    *   Added `dotenv` and `@supabase/supabase-js` as dependencies.
    *   Collaboratively debugged and resolved issues with `.env.local` file naming (`env.local` -> `.env.local`) and script pathing.
    *   **Outcome:** Confirmed a successful connection to the user's Supabase project. The API keys are correct and the authentication service is accessible.

**16:00 - 16:15 UTC | Monorepo Scripting (Task 1.5)**

*   **Summary:** Implemented a unified scripting approach to manage all services from the root directory, simplifying the development workflow.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Created a root `package.json` to act as the monorepo orchestrator.
    *   Added `concurrently` and `npm-run-all` to run multiple scripts in parallel.
    *   **New Root Scripts:**
        *   `npm install`: Now automatically installs dependencies for all services (`install-all`).
        *   `npm run dev`: Starts frontend, backend, and ML services simultaneously.
        *   `npm run build-all`: Builds frontend and backend projects in parallel.
        *   `npm run test-all`: Runs test suites for all services.
    *   Refined `package.json` scripts in both the frontend and backend services to include `lint:fix`, `test:watch`, and `format` commands.
*   **Outcome:** The project can now be managed with simple, intuitive commands from the root folder, significantly improving developer experience.
